# Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit

<P>With the increasing adoption of the gig economy, enterprises are beginning to integrate freelance talent into their already-complex sourcing models. While adding freelancers to the mix can offer significant benefits in enterprise environments, the path to transforming existing policies and processes is largely undefined.</p>

<p>Like many of our industry peers, Microsoft is also in the process of navigating how to responsibly weave freelance engagement into our enterprise environment. As we stood up our program, we realized that other enterprises might find it useful to learn more about how we’re changing and adapting to this flexible environment, including how we're configuring and using Microsoft 365 tools.</p>

<h2>What's in the toolkit?</h1>
<p>The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit reflects what we’ve learned and configured to date to support our growing enterprise freelance operations, and was designed to help you leverage your existing technology investments to operate collaboratively with freelancers at scale.</p>

<p>It includes templates, configuration guidance, and best practices for the four solution areas that we’ve found most impactful in our own enterprise, with case studies that give you our real-world experiences to draw from in your own transformation.</p>

<h2>Why freelance?</h2>
    <p>Every enterprise will have different reasons for embracing the gig economy. In the case studies included in this toolkit, you'll see that Microsoft employees who have actually worked with freelancers have similar stories of going from initial fear and skepticism, to feeling empowered by new opportunities for scale and impact. As a result of this growth mindset and willingness to try a new way of working, we're able to deliver more value to our customers.</p>
    <p>[placeholder for public-facing templates video maybe? Erren and Drew are working on this for Chad. Would also link "case studies" above to a landing page for all of the case studies.]</p>
